Today I learned a lot about linux and some of it's command lines.

I install ZSH and also customized using OhMyZsh plugins from github.

I took a surface knowledge about SSH and other linux fundamentals as well bash shell fundamentals.

Tomorrow I'm gonna deep dive into SSH and linux with AWS...
Thank you
