This is my day 1 of learning devOps.

Step 1: I learned about fundamental concepts about devops. Devops is basically a way for developing a software. It is the process through which a software goes from planning, coding, deployment, maintenance, operation and monitoring.

Step 2: I focused primarily on those above concepts. Planning is the first step for making a software. Here the developers and planner teams collaborate to make decisions on how the software will be formed. They make the wireframe of the looking of the software and also collect the information from the client about the type of software they want to build.

Step 3: After the planning phase is done, the developers starts to write a code. They write a code as per the instructions and planning.

Step 3: Testing is done to prevent any fault in software after it is deployed. It is done by QA of a team. Their primary role is to test the quality and bugs of the software. They test the software using various tools. This is very important phase so that there won't be any problem for the end user to use the software or application.

Step 4: Deployment is done after above steps. In this phase, the source code of the application is deployed to a server or a cloud architecture. The code is categorized into containers and a docker image is also created to make sure the deployment becomes fast and efficient.

Step 5: Maintenace and monitoring is done after the deployment. Pipelines are created to do continuous integration and deployment of the software.

Step 6: I learned about why big companies integrate with devOps teams for their software development life cycle. Netflix, Amazon are big examples of it. Their system is fast due to the use of devops life cycle.

Step 6: It was the time to choose the programming language for devOps. I 'm from the MERN Stack background. I know javascript and it's frontent and backend framework like react, redux and node.js mongoose. The most common programming language to choose for devops is Golang and Python. With useless brainstorming I choose to learn Golang.

Step 7: I started a course on Youtube from TechWorld with Nana.

I started golang by setting the environment and installing the go language. Then after that I've created a folder called Golang and also a src folder inside it. 

The golang should be a initialized by the command as go mod init <app_name>

I got some gopls erros while writing the code. I searched the whole stackoverflow but didn't got the solution. The error was due to the latest version of goland which is 1.18.

Vs code asked me to install some packages automatically and I installed but also the error was still there. I didn't figured out how to solve it. I closed my pc. After some hours I opened the same folder but this time the error was gone... How amazing and I still don't know how that happened. ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ 

After that a go.mod file is created inside the repository.
main.go is the initial file for starting to code in golang language.

It is started by writing:

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Print("Hello World")
}

After that the file is executed by the command as go run src/main.go

After all the things I pushed the files to my github repo...


Thank you for day 1...

Excited to learn more in Day 2....
