Today is day 3. Today I"m gonna finish the golang course by TechWorld with Nana.


We can also have a unused variable and we can denote it by _

Today I learne about loops, if else in golang which are pretty similar with c and c++ programming which I have already learned. 

Another way to write for loop in golang is 

for someCondition > 0 && len(someCondition) < 50 {
    <!-- Execute this block of code -->
}
