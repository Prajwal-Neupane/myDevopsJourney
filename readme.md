I started the 90 days devops challenge. I wanted to enhance my career and skillset to be better in devOps and it's best practices. I'm gonna make sure tht I will be consistent while doing this challenge. I've also forked the repo from MichaelCade/90DaysofDevOps so that I will be able to self analyze my journey. So this is also the repository I"m going to upload to github and track my progress.

This will be helpful to me for my future because of documenting everything I'm going to learn during this challenge.

So here starts the journey...
